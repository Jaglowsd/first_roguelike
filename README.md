Goal: Translating the dark souls universe into a roguelike! 

One of my favorites generes of video games are roguelikes/lites. In my opinion roguelikes contain some of the most replayable content in gaming as a whole. Done well, these games can lead to thousands of hours of new and exciting outcomes that cannot be consumed in a month of playing. Traditional roguelikes sport ASCII graphics, permadeath, procedural map, enemy, and loot generation, long play times, and turn-based gameplay. Modern games use some of these mechanics while innovating in their own ways-these are referred to as roguelites.

One of my favorite video game franchises is the Dark Souls series, including Bloodborne. The games contains intricate combat, world, and boss design. Anyone familiar with the series or the name will immediately attribute the words "challenging" or "die over and over". This is most certaintly true but the reward for a player's patience and adaptability outweighs the game's difficulty. 

Now combining the two is what I decided I wanted to do! Introducing - Rogue Souls. I wanted to capture the old feeling of roguelikes such as "Rogue", "Angband", and some more modern rougelikes such as "Cogmind" and Brogue" while also incorporating familiar mechanics and themes from the Dark Souls universe.
